"""
Example: Raw SQL Execution with data-bridge-postgres

This example demonstrates how to execute raw SQL queries using the execute() function.
This is useful for power users who need features not available in the ORM, such as:
- Complex joins
- Window functions
- Custom aggregations
- DDL operations
- Database-specific functions

IMPORTANT: Always use parameterized queries ($1, $2, etc.) to prevent SQL injection!
