# Change: Document API Server Capabilities

## Why
The `data-bridge-api` component has reached significant maturity (Phase 7 partial completion), achieving parity with many FastAPI features. However, it lacks formal OpenSpec documentation and developer guides. Integrating this documentation is crucial for visibility and future development.

## What Changes
- **New Spec**: `api-server` capability defined in `openspec/specs/api-server/spec.md`.
- **New Dev Docs**: Architecture and implementation details in `dev-docs/80-api-server/`.
- **Benchmark Analysis**: Gap analysis report for API benchmarks.

## Impact
- Affected specs: `api-server` (new)
- Affected code: None (Docs only)
