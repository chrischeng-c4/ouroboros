# data-bridge-test: Quality Management Framework

## 🎯 Framework Positioning

**data-bridge-test** is a comprehensive Quality Management Framework for the data-bridge project, providing enterprise-grade testing capabilities across three core pillars:

- **🛡️ Security Testing**: Fuzzing, payload injection, vulnerability discovery, and compliance validation
- **⚡ Performance Testing**: Benchmarking, profiling, resource tracking, and regression detection
- **✅ Functional Testing**: Test execution, assertions, coverage tracking, and quality gates

This framework enables teams to build reliable, secure, and performant database systems by integrating testing at every layer of the development lifecycle.

## 📋 Three-Pillar Structure

### Pillar 1: 🛡️ Security Testing
Identify vulnerabilities, prevent injection attacks, and ensure compliance with security standards.

**Core Components**:
- `Fuzzer`: Mutation-based and structural fuzzing engine
- `PayloadsDB`: Curated security test payloads (NoSQL, SQL, Command Injection, etc.)
- `SecurityValidator`: Runtime security policy enforcement
- `ComplianceChecker`: Standards validation (OWASP, MongoDB security)

### Pillar 2: ⚡ Performance Testing
Measure, optimize, and prevent regressions in latency, throughput, and resource usage.

**Core Components**:
- `Benchmark`: Statistical benchmarking with adaptive iterations
- `Profiler`: CPU, memory, and allocation tracking
- `ResourceMonitor`: Real-time resource usage tracking
- `RegressionDetector`: Historical trend analysis and alerts

### Pillar 3: ✅ Functional Testing
Validate correctness, coverage, and quality gates for all test scenarios.

**Core Components**:
- `TestRunner`: Test discovery, execution, and orchestration
- `Assertions`: Fluent assertion library with custom matchers
- `CoverageTracker`: Code coverage collection and visualization
- `Reporter`: Multi-format output (JUnit XML, HTML, TUI, JSON)
