# Challenge Report: validation-custom-validators-2

## Summary
[Overall assessment of the proposal quality and readiness]

## Internal Consistency Issues
[Check if proposal files are consistent with each other]
[Examples: Does proposal.md match tasks.md? Do Mermaid diagrams in specs/ match descriptions? Do task spec refs exist?]
[These are HIGH priority - must fix before implementation]

### Issue: [Title]
- **Severity**: High
- **Category**: Completeness | Consistency
- **Description**: [What's inconsistent]
- **Location**: [Which files/sections]
- **Recommendation**: [How to fix]

## Code Alignment Issues
[Check if proposal aligns with existing codebase]

[IMPORTANT: If proposal mentions refactoring or BREAKING changes, deviations are EXPECTED]

### Issue: [Title]
- **Severity**: Medium | Low
- **Category**: Conflict | Other
- **Description**: [What differs from existing code]
- **Location**: [File paths or components]
- **Note**: [Is this intentional? Check proposal.md for refactor mentions]

[These are LOW priority - nice to have improvements]

### Issue: [Title]
- **Severity**: Low
- **Category**: Completeness | Other
- **Description**: [What could be improved]
- **Recommendation**: [Suggested enhancement]
